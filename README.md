# Abstarct : iPCA is an Interactive System for PCA-based Visual Analytics which provides options to explore the Principal Component Analysis and make the understanding easy of this "Black Box".We design the interface using multiple coordinated views, and add a rich set of interactions for both interacting with the views and interacting with the PCA calculations.
